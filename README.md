### WHAT I NEED TO DO

# Render a game in the browser
# Switch turns between more than one player
# Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
# Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
# Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles
# Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
# Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
# Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


### PLANNING

# We need to have 6 boxes for the 9 different choices of the player
# Player needs to click on the chosen box and it needs to add a cross or circle depending on turns
# If a player click on one then the next one will be a different player
