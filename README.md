### WHAT I NEED TO DO

# Render a game in the browser
# Switch turns between more than one player
# Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
# Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
# Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles
# Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
# Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
# Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
